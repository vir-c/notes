## Containers/ Containerized apps
Most apps today run on cloud, the cloud here means multi-region data centers with 10000s of high performing servers. To efficiently use the resources of these servers, 
through a process called virtualization, the computing resources of these servers are divided to create multiple smaller units that run indepedendently and in isolation.     
Virtualization can be acheived through hypervisor or OS-level virtualization (See below diagram).     
Docker is a software suite which provides OS-level virtualization and creates isolated `containers`. These containers can run `containerized software apps` through docker images.
